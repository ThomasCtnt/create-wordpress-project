### Add plugins, mu-plugins and themes

To add third party plugins, mu-plugins and themes, use Composer with the help of [wpackagist.org](https://wpackagist.org/). For example, to add the [Classic Editor]() plugin, you can do the following:

```bash
composer require wpackagist/classic-editor
```

By default, everything in the subfolders of `web/wp-content` are ignored by Git to avoid tracking thir party packages installed with Composer. To add your custom plugins and themes to your Git repository, you have to add rules in the `.gitignore` file:

```ruby
!/web/wp-content/mu-plugins/my-mu-plugin.php
!/web/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin/
```
